Intuition behind eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

- [Mathstackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/243533/how-to-intuitively-understand-eigenvalue-and-eigenvector)
- [EigenMorality](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1820)

### Punchlines from above links
-------------------------------
-------------------------------

- **Eigenpairs are a lot like the roots of a polynomial**. While roots of a polynomial is that they ground the polynomial(fix its shape), eigenvalues limit the behavior of the linear transformation.

- The eigenvalues of a linear mapping is a measure of the distortion induced by the transformation and the eigenvectors tell you about how the distortion is oriented.
